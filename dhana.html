        Color (American English) or colour (British English) is the visual perceptual property
     deriving from the spectrum of light interacting with the photoreceptor cells of the eyes. 
     Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects or materials
    based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. 
    By defining a color space, colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates.
    Because perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of different types of
    cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified
   by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or physiological quantifications 
   of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of color appearance.
